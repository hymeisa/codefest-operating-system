# File System Package

## Overview
This package provides classes to simulate a basic file system structure in Java. It includes classes for representing files, directories, and a main class to demonstrate the usage of these classes.

## Classes

### `FileSystemItem`
- Represents a file or directory in the file system.

### `Directory`
- Represents a directory which can contain files and sub-directories.

### `File`
- Represents a file in the file system.

### `FileStructure`
- Main class to demonstrate the usage of the file system classes.

## Usage
1. Instantiate objects of `Directory`, `File`, and `FileStructure` classes to create and organize your file system.
2. Use `addChild()` method to add files and sub-directories to a directory.
3. Use `getSize()` method to calculate the size of a directory or a file.

## Example
```java
public class FileStructure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your example code here
    }
}
